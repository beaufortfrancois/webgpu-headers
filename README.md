# WebGPU headers

This repository contains C headers for interacting with [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/), a modern graphics and compute API designed for the web.

The [`webgpu.h`](webgpu.h) C header file lists all the available procedures and data structures of WebGPU. 
It serves as a platform-agnostic hardware abstraction layer, allowing developers to build platform-specific applications by providing a consistent interface across different platforms.
